# GitHub Folders & Files (GFF) Read Me

[Source code]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-2020/ )

## Concept

Obtain data from selected GitHub folders and files and display as links in details/summary that update location.hash


* Use [GitHub Developer API]( https://developer.github.com/v3/ ) to obtain a list of files in a GitHub repo
* Build menu to access the files
* Display a breadcrumb menu to display the current path

The script makes API calls and reads the data one folder at a time. This may be considered a feature or an issue.

"Maevia" is delighted to receive your sample files - especially files with two versions - broken and fixed - for testing.
