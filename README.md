## Concept


### 2021-08-29

The Spider Viewer 2021 is now an early stage work-in-progress.

Mix and match OSM, RAD, HBJSON and gbXML files in the same scene
Load multiple files via URL, file dialog or drag & drop
Drag and drop models in the scene to new locations
Decompress and load models from ZIP file automatically
Explore dozens of sample files
View renderer statistics and frames per seconds
Right-click surfaces to view their details in a pop-up

Instead of multiple viewers each supporting a single file format, it's now one viewer that can read any number of formats.

There's more

* Faster drawing algorithms. Try [urban_district.hbjson]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2021/spider-viewer/#https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ladybug-tools/honeybee-schema@master/samples/model_large/urban_district.hbjson). It takes a while lo load, but once it's up: click the reload button. Over the next few weeks the new routines will be refactored into all file format loaders
* More file formats to be added. Anybody want IFC or EPW or Design Explorer support?
* Better user experience in moving, viewing and editing the dat

Of course, many if not all the features will be added

And, as always, you don't have to change! All the previous releases will continue to be available.



### Mission

* Provide fast, simple open source file manipulators for many open data Architecture, Engineering, & Construction (AEC) file types for 3D building data
* Load and display a variety of AEC industry standard file formats
	* Rhino 3DM
	* gbXML
	* Khronos [GLTF & GLB]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF )
	* Ladybug Tools HBJSON
	* EnergyPlus IDF & OSM
	* OBJ
	* Radiance RAD
	* STL
	* VTK
* Load files via URL, operating system file dialog and Drag & Drop
* Load multiple files of various type unto a single scene
* Automatically decompress models in ZIP files and load them into the scene
* Translate double bytes character files to single byte (UTF-16 to UTF-8)

* Export files into industry-standard rendering, animation and gaming formats
* Export a scene with multiple models into a single new file
* Enable a feature-rich 3D interaction with models
* View renderer and frames per second statistics

* Access an extensive collection of sample data files
* Creates a standard user experience across the range of Spider apps
* Become the major Spider project for this year
* Create a single unified set of files for developing and testing the interaction between dozens of modules
* Gather all the Spider 3D file viewers into a single cooperative framework
* Enable new types of reports and presentations
* Simplify testing and adding features across the range of viewers

### Vision

* The issues of communication between the many disciplines in AEC - [Islands of Automation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_of_automation ) - become almost non-existent.
* All the apps may share data in near real time with all the other apps.
* All the apps export and import data in the file format of their choice
* The Spider apps "magic" is to read the data in one format and write the data in another format
* The spider process relies on multiple small apps each custom tailored to a single task: translating information from one specific format to another specific format.
* There are be multiple apps for for every format. For example the translator for gbXML files going from a Bentley product to a Sephora may be differnt that the translator for gbXML files going from an NREL product goint to an Autodesk product.
* There may be further forks so that an app is custom-tailored for, say, an Arup's workflow or a  Trane workflow.
* The apps - for the most part - are small and simple coding efforts written in easy to read and decipher formats. They are customizable to specific workflows by entry and medium level developers.


### Problems to be solved

>The [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]( https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld ), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth â€“ all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

All members of the AEC community must take an active role implementing the relevant goals. These may include:

* Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
	* Target 1.4: By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance &lt;br&gt;
* Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

_Further revisions of this document will highlight relevant goal, targets and indicators._

### Proposed solutions / Benefits

* Help clients and developers get up to speed with with what has to be done and with radically more clear explanations on how to do it
* Help gifted, talented and experienced professionals be more productive, useful and
* Guide students and learners into effective pathways for gaining domain expertise
* Bridge the gaps between AEC professionals and computer programmers
