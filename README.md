### Problems to be solved

>The [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]( https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld ), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth â€“ all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

All members of the AEC community must take an active role implementing the relevant goals. These may include:

* Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
	* Target 1.4: By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance &lt;br&gt;
* Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

_Further revisions of this document will highlight relevant goal, targets and indicators._

### Proposed solutions / Benefits

* Help clients and developers get up to speed with with what has to be done and with radically more clear explanatiopns on how to do it
* Help gifted, talented and experienced professionals be more productive, useful and
* Guide students and learners into effective pathways for gaining domain expertise
* Bridge the gaps between AEC professionals and computer programmers

### Features

* Load and display a variety of AEC industry standard file types for 3D building data
* Enable a feature-rich 3D interaction with models
* Export files into industry-standard rendering, animation and gaming formats
* A major Spider project for this year
* A single unified set of files for developing and testing the interaction between dozens of modules
* Gather all the Spider 3D file viewers into a single cooperative framework
* Enable new types of reports and presentations
* Simplify testing and adding features across the range of viewers
* Create a standard user experience across the range of Spider apps
